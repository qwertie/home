Alternate Chapter 114 (solution to [Final Exam](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/113)):
- I correctly understood that Harry's wand must be touching the matter to be transfigured, but that the transfigured object can grow to an almost unlimited distance away from the wand. The total mass and volume must be very small for a rapid transfiguration. Partial transfiguration of air should work: Harry fails to convert air into a paperclip in Chapter 28, but this failure happens before he learns partial transfiguration. I was not at all confident that a single carbon nanotube would be strong enough to use as a weapon, hence the use of thread.
- I wrote this before reading the real Chapter 114. Having now read it, I must say, I considered antimatter as a solution, but rejected it immediately because it seemed much less plausible than transfiguration of air: surely Harry has never practiced making it, magic isn't necessarily familiar with the word "antimatter" - does Harry at least know how it fits into the Standard Model? Magic might not even be _able_ to make it, and Harry is unlikely to know how to quickly create a reliable containment chamber in order to create the desired quantity; immediate detonation will probably destroy only the wand. Therefore, I did not think Harry could use antimatter as a threat in parseltoungue. Conversely, if he creates too much he might destroy Hogwarts which is just a couple of miles away. Plus, if Voldemort believes the threat of antimatter (which he should in parseltongue) he might Apparate to a safe distance or have Harry killed immediately.
- In my version I forgot that Harry could shrink transfigured objects, but I'm skeptical of Yudkowsky's solution. First, because I'm not sure a single nanotube is strong enough to slice through flesh without risk of breaking. The black nanotube line in Chapter 28 was obviously more than one molecule wide, since it was clearly visible on the table. How could Harry know that a single-molecule thread is strong enough? Second, if the line is only a single molecule, it seems to me that the shrinking process itself, if it works at all, is likely to weaken the line because it would have to work by deleting groups of atoms, creating temporary gaps in the line. It is non-obvious whether the 'magical force' that removes these gaps is itself as strong as a carbon nanotube line, and Harry himself certainly doesn't know. My solution instead supposes that Harry knows how to make a braid.
- I was reluctant to kill the Death Eaters outright, thinking that Lucius, who seemed to show signs of redemption, was among them. Also, I imagined that a solution involving 37 separate and precisely-placed invisible nooses would be too difficult for a first-year student to build in one minute, so I found something simpler.
- Having done no experiments, Harry did not know how the Voldemort-resonance worked so it was very dangerous to use Stuporfy against Voldemort. If "the effect of the resonance mostly hit the caster, with power proportional to the caster's power", it should have hurt Harry more than Voldemort.
- Frankly I was unimpressed with the whole idea of Harry visualizing "clouds of amplitude in a multiparticle configuration space" (Ch 28). I'm pretty sure humans are incapable of visualizing any kind of vaguely realistic quantum wavefunction - the math of two entangled particles, okay, plausible, but anything of realistic complexity quickly goes beyond human ability. It's in HPMOR cannon so I "must" accept it, but like, you can't compute Shor's algorithm in your head, so how are you to visualize the configuration space? In reality, I'm pretty sure that ridiculously, incomputably complex levels of entangement happen constantly all around us, it's just beyond our ability to imagine or perceive (even in principle).
- Harry's delay tactic and initial transfiguration are my own ideas, but I needed to skim other reviews for inspiration... e.g. initially I forgot about nanotubes entirely.

Chapter 114: 114 seconds of rationality
---------------------------------------------

The young boy standing naked before Voldemort felt like he needed all his strength merely to keep standing. His muscles were tired and aching from miles of walking; his hands and feet faintly cried in pain from the cold breeze. The stress of watching multiple homicides, the news that he was to be murdered, cut into pieces, and his loved ones tortured... all because because he'd failed yet again. A part of him dreamed of falling down that very moment. A vision of giving up, falling to the ground in exhaustion, curses hitting his body in answer for his disobedience. _He taught you to lose_, came the thought. _Now you've mastered it_. 

_NO!_ he thought, his dark side stirring. _You can rest when you're dead — find the way out!_

His parents... McGonagall... Draco... if he failed here, the Dark Lord would torture and kill them. _No!_ His icy intelligence rebuked him. _There are six billion others._ Anything he did to _help_ Voldemort made it easier for him to conquer the world. Say the wrong thing and millions or billions might suffer. He could say nothing without thought to the consequences, but estimating consequences would take time.

_List possible responses, buffer them, speak the safest — no! Need more time to predict consequences. Buy time. Still confused!_ "You ssaid you ssaved girl child for me. Caussed unbreakable vow. Killing me afterward does not make ssense."

"Foolishness! Is this why you remain composed in the face of certain death? I do intend to kill you, boy, _thiss I promisse_."

"Did not intend to take your immortality," Harry hissed slowly through gritted teeth, eyes looking down. "Only intended to ssave girl-child and esscape. Decission to shoot happened before your deception."

"I designed the curse myself, boy. I knew what would break it and I felt it break. _There iss flaw in my cursse, yes, but it sserved only me._"

Why was a Dark Lord of vastly greater power and experience still asking for help from a first-year student? Harry wasn't smarter, but he had mental tools the genius Voldemort lacked, tools that could help him learn things the Dark Lord knew not. Harry understood people better—Voldemort was unlikely to care about that. But also, skill at weighing evidence. An understanding of cognitive biases. Techniques for finding ideas. The scientific method—though Voldemort might well begin using it himself soon.

"No more stalling, boy, I shall continue the countdown regardless. 50 seconds."

Planning fallacy—his thought process would take too long. Confirmation bias—Dark Lord is _certain_ prophecy refers to Harry! Anchoring—Dark Lord asks you to speak, so you think of things to say! _The wand!_

"The prophessy, doess it sspeak of me by name?"

"No, but the timing of a prophecy is important. In the moment of your friend's death there was but one person with the motive to destroy the world and an instinct like mine to crave it. 40 seconds."

Harry had spent 5 seconds thinking of things that could be partially-transfigured from air. Poison gas? Knockout gas? Slow-acting, Death Eaters far away... Atom bomb? Stupid! Antimatter? Don't know how. Nanotech? Invisible, good! Not sure how to make it—

In his spare time, Harry had often thought of his very first encounter with magic, when Professor McGonagall had transformed into a cat. It was a different species with incompatible DNA, and even two creatures with the same DNA could have different blood vessels and different patterns of fur. First-year wizards knew nothing of DNA, ribosomes, vacuoles, mitocondria, cell membranes—yet even they could transform a material into "wood". This wood would have to be either fake wood (something that _looked and behaved_ like wood), or real wood, with wood DNA, mitocondria and all the rest. Either way, Harry had deduced that the _knowledge_ of how to arrange the molecules (or whatever actually happened during transfiguration) could not have come from the students themselves and so must have arrived from elsewhere, adding itself to the transfiguration process "automagically"—Harry had laughed, thinking that this ought to be a real and perfectly meaningful word in a Hogwarts' dictionary, though it wasn't listed in the dictionary he checked. The behavior of his mokeskin pouch implied the same thing when it had responded to a Hebrew word for "gold" that neither Harry nor the maker of the pouch would have understood. Magic knew and applied knowledge learned by others, like an AI servant with access to — what did they call that new thing? The internet?

So it was on this hypothesis that Harry—who had spent his schoolyear thinking about everything _except_ obvious reasons to be suspicious about the the Defense Professor—had tried to create a desktop nanofactory. When that failed, he tried something less ambitious: transfiguring a rock into a large solar-powered desk calculator. After only six hours and thirteen attempts, he had a working calculator. (After ten attempts he'd consulted with Hermoine, who mentioned something about electricity not working inside Hogwarts, so he'd added a Faraday cage around it, which had proven important). Harry had studied concepts like flip-flops, registers, BCD and digital circuits for addition, but did not know how to do multiplication and division in binary; the calculator worked anyway. Later, the same principle had worked in Azkaban to help transfigure the rocket: rockets were notorious for exploding if they weren't engineered to excellent precision, and just how were the propellant molecules to be packed anyway? Harry had never transfigured something to be burned, and neither Harry nor Quirrel were rocket scientists; but Harry had estimated a high probability that their magic could fill in gaps in their rocketry knowledge.

Twenty percent—that had been his estimate of the risk of death if there were problems in his first attempt to make a rocket, and in the present moment, taking that risk again was a no-brainer.

For five more seconds Harry tried to think of something tiny and simple enough for him to transfigure—

"Thirty seconds."

—and another ten seconds actually starting to transfigure the air near the tip of his wand into layers of tiny vacuoles thereupon. Another part of him screamed that it wouldn't be enough. It was too simple—he couldn't design or program nanomachines fast enough so he'd used simple lipid sacs, but he wasn't likely to have an opportunity to get the wand close enough to Voldemort to unleash the poison he was building.

Finally a better idea came to Harry, but it was going to take somewhat more than the 20 seconds he had left. An thread of carbon nanotubes as thick as his own hair formed at the tip of his wand and lowered to the ground with perfect verticality, the cold evening breeze neutralized by a force of will. At ground level, the thread turned toward the semicircle of Death Eaters and grew in that direction until it passed between two sets of 36 legs before splitting into three new threads, each one-third as thick as the original line. Harry wasn't sure how to split a nanotube thread in a way that would maintain its strength; the magic was doing the job for him, but perhaps he could make sure? Harry added a blob of steel around the tubes at the point where they split, to add strength, and glanced toward it to make sure that what he had built with his mind actually existed out there in the desired location. He extended the steel piece down into the ground slightly, to help keep the nanotubes suspended several inches above the ground. One thread grew leftward while another grew rightward, behind the Death Eaters, with tiny, barely visible vertical pedestals appearing every few feet to hold the lines several inches above the ground. Finally the lines reached the end of the semicircle and extended toward the soil, then into the soil, as Harry's sixty seconds ran out—

"Last chance, boy! Speak or die!"

Harry hissed: "The prophessy—you were involved in it alsso. You killed girl-child, which created future in which we are enemiess. Unbreakable vow bindss me, but not you, sso you are now mosst likely ssubject of prophessy. In Hall of Prophessy, prophessy is revealed only to ssubject of prophessy. If you kill me now, cannot verify later that prophessy appliess to me."

As Harry spoke, the ends of the two nanotube lines attached themselves to small steel anchors which then extended several metres into the ground. Voldemort had been pacing around near the left side of the semicircle of Death Eaters, but stopped and stared at Harry for a precious moment. Harry looked back at Voldemort, feeling his third line growing up invisibly behind the Dark Lord's back. Now what? Harry thought frantically.

"When I die, you will have no one to give you ssecond opinionss, warn you of danger," Harry continued. "You thought that I needed girl-child friend to act against prophessy, but perhapss it is you who needs boy-child friend to act against prophessy. Perhapss you need me."

Harry tied off the line, then began growing a third anchor a few feet away from Voldemort. Beneath the moonlight glinted a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line extending many metres into the ground. 

"The boy is being uncooperative, but he makes an interesting point. To verify absolutely that he is the subject of the prophecy, as I believe he is, we would have to take him to the Hall of Prophecy, or bring the orb here. Keep your wands trained on the boy. I need a moment to consider this."

Finally, Harry reversed the transfiguration on the segment of the third line that connected it to the other two lines — so far so good! So now—wait! His wand was made of wood!

Voldemort began to walk toward the altar when suddenly his head snapped back—or rather one leg continued forward while his head did not. A strange sound like gurgling came from his throat as blood poured out, and a few heads turned toward the Dark Lord. "Lord!" screamed one of the robed figures, then all the other heads began to turn. Unseen to any observer, a single loop of nanotube wire was embedded in Voldemort's neck, anchored to the ground a short distance away.

Harry had added a thin layer of iron around his wand and around the beginning of the nanotube line. Perhaps it wasn't enough, but most of the Death Eaters were looking at the Dark Lord and already some were glancing back at Harry. Now or never!

Harry yanked his wand backward, and four Death Eaters in the middle of the semicircle screamed as their feet separated from their bodies. As the others turned to look in confusion, Harry stepped forward, then ran backward, holding the wand with both hands as the nanotube lines began to slice through the legs of the other 32 Death Eaters. It was like a knife cutting through butter, but this was a lot of butter, and Harry needed all his meagre strength to keep pulling. Black robes, falling... suddenly all resistance disappeared and he dropped to the ground, just as spells started flying over his head.

Harry reversed the transfigurations on the end of his wand, freeing it from the nanotube lines and deleting his earlier mistake. The altar was just a few meters away—and beside it, his pouch and time-turner. He glanced toward the fallen Death Eaters as blood spilled out in litres, and someone screamed a word: "attack!"

He rolled himself and with a smooth motion pushed himself up, sprinted toward the altar and dove behind cover, scraping his hands and knees against the sandy ground as three or four spells smacked the altar harmlessly. He glanced around, saw the time-turner, grabbed it—

In an empty graveyard a few miles away from Hogwarts, a naked child appeared on the ground, blood oozing from dirty wounds. The boy screamed in pain, paused, and then took a well-deserved moment to laugh. And then, realizing that he had forgotten his clothes and his pouch in the future, he laughed a second time, as the tears began to flow uncontrollably.
