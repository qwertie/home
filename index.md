### My open source work ###

- [Loyc](http://loyc.net): a collection of ideas and projects for programming language interoperability standards, including [Loyc trees](http://loyc.net/loyc-trees) and [LES](http://loyc.net/les).
- [Loyc Core Libraries](http://core.loyc.net): general-purpose C# libraries with the theme of "things that should be built into the .NET framework, but arenâ€™t". See also: [Doxygen reference](http://ecsharp.net/doc/code/).
- [LLLPG](http://ecsharp.net/lllpg/): a parser generator for C# that generates efficient code and integrates with Visual Studio.
- [LeMP](http://ecsharp.net/lemp/): a language-agnostic Lisp-style macro processor that allows you to run arbitrary code at compile time. Currently implemented only for C#.
- [Enhanced C#](http://ecsharp.net) (EC#): a superset of C# used by LeMP.
- [Ungglish](http://ungglish.loyc.net): an incomplete idea for an alternative to English as a second language.
