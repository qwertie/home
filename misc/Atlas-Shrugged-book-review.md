title: "Atlas Shrugged - Book Review"

---

Allow me to confess: I never intended to read this book, and I knew almost nothing about Ayn Rand beforehand. I had read Yudkowsky's [Guardians of Ayn Rand](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/96TBXaHwLbFyeAxrg/guardians-of-ayn-rand), which was not flattering to Rand, and later I heard someone say they could tell Atlas Shrugged was "garbage" after three pages. I was curious what it was that didn't impress people and decided to find out. However, after three pages it didn't seem like garbage at all, and I ended up reading long enough to want to learn the book's mysteries, such as why businessmen kept disappearing, and what was causing the deterioration of the world. I was downloading it one chapter at a time from a random website, in such a way that there was no way to tell how long it was in advance.

Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, turned out to be longer than I could possibly have imagined: 1168 pages. It's about 3.10 megabytes of plain ASCII and more than half a million words. It is 2.7 times longer than the Arthur C. Clark trilogy "2001: A Space Odyssey", "2010: Odyssey Two" and "2061: Odyssey Three" (these are 1.13 MB in total). It's the kind of book that invites comparisons with the distance to the moon, and if I wrote like Rand does, I would sprinkle nine such comparisons throughout this review. The language is somewhat dense and awkward, as though the words were chosen specifically to slow down my reading of them. The book is divided into three parts of ten chapters each, but it is certainly not a trilogy, since important mysteries are stretched out from nearly the beginning until nearly the end, like the men who fought so hard over a penny that they invented copper wire.

Reportedly, it sold 29 million copies by 2013, with almost 3 million copies purchased for distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand institute. In 1991, Atlas Shrugged was number two behind the Bible in a survey asking for "the most influential book in the respondent's life".

I spend over 80 hours reading this book, and if I knew how big it was in advance, I would not have bothered. Seeing Scott's call for book reviews is the only thing that would allow me to read all the way to the end, although I couldn't help skipping sentences and paragraphs sometimes.

This review has minor spoilers. Also, I decided that no one else should have to go through what I did, so I prepared a [condensed version of the story](http://david.loyc.net/misc/Atlas-Shrugged-summary) for this review on a separate page, because I don't believe reading it is worth dozens of hours of anyone's time — but it might be worth one or two, if only for the value of pretending you have read an entire book by Ayn Rand. I think the story could have fit in one-fifth the word count and still have told the same story equally well (and probably better).

As as an Effective Altruist, aspiring rationalist and a fan of Scott's [Non-Libertarian FAQ](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/), you'll not be surprised that she did not win me over to her creed — not that it was possible to pin down her creed precisely from the book, anyway.

While Ayn Rand was influential in the development of modern American libertarianism, she rejected the label herself. This quote [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Modern_libertarianism_in_the_United_States) doesn't explain why to my satisfaction:

> All kinds of people today call themselves "libertarians," especially something calling itself the New Right, which consists of hippies who are anarchists instead of leftist collectivists; but anarchists are collectivists. Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet libertarians combine capitalism and anarchism. That's worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It's a mockery of philosophy and ideology. They sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons. They want to be hippies, but don't want to preach collectivism because those jobs are already taken. But anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect. Anarchists are the scum of the intellectual world of the Left, which has given them up. So the Right picks up another leftist discard. That's the libertarian movement.

Are what she calls "libertarians" the same as a modern hardcore "all taxes are theft" libertarians? That's not how it sounds to me.

The book is set in some indeterminite future time, "centuries" after the industrial revolution and "centuries" after the fictional Nathaniel "Nat" Taggart built a transcontinental railway across the United States. Taggart built his railroad with no government handouts, and proudly held his goal to be making a profit.

Despite the passage of time, Rand's future world looks as it would if all human innovation had stopped on a dime in 1957. Wired telephones, telegraphs, radio broadcasts, television and newspapers are the only major forms of communication; typewriters (with carbon copies!) are the primary means of writing; railroads are powered by coal and deisel; passenger trains are preferred over airplanes; computers are nowhere to be seen; prices are plausible for 1957; and many skyscrapers are beginning to crack and crumble from old age and neglect.

> He enjoyed the sight of a prosperous street; not more than every fourth one of the stores was out of business, its windows dark and empty. - Chapter 1

The book never once mentions communism, socialism or collectivism, but aside from the United States, most of the countries mentioned are "people's states" and the others are about to turn into them: The People's State of Mexico, The People's State of Norway, The People's State of France, the People's State of England, the People's State of Portugal, the People's State of Turkey, the People's State of China, the People's State of Germany, the People's State of Chile, the People's State of India, and the People's State of Guatemala. In Part 3 Chapter 4, Argentina becomes a People's State.

 Keep in mind that the book was published after many years of McCarthyism, at the tail end of the Second Red Scare, which I'm told lasted from the late 1940s through the 1950s. Rand clearly thought that communism was a serious threat, despite already being widely unpopular among Americans. The book eventually gets around to spending ample time attacking communist ideas, but she only attacks the most superficial elements, like "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need."

Quick reviews from 1957
---------------------

> It is probably the worst piece of large fiction written since Miss Rand’s equally weighty “The Fountainhead.” - Robert R. Kirsch LA Times, 1957

> [...] a book every businessman should hug to his breast [...] But how the shabby little left-wingers are going to hate it! - Paul Jordan-Smith, Los Angeles Times, 1957

> Gigantic, relentless, often fantastic, this book is definitely not one to be swallowed whole. Throughout its 1,168 pages, Miss Rand never cracks a smile. Conversations deteriorate into monologues as one character after another laboriously declaims his set of values. - Newsweek, 1957

> There is much good sense in this book and it deserves more careful consideration than it is likely to get. [...] The worst thing in her book is her denunciation of what she calls mysticism [...] No, Miss Rand, a mystic is a man who insists upon using those areas of his mind which you block off. - Edward Wagenknecht, Chicago Daily Tribune, 1957

> Miss Rand’s villains resemble no one I have ever encountered, and I finally decided to call them “liberals,” chiefly because I can’t imagine whom else she might have in mind. [...] America is plunged into a catastrophic depression, caused by the government’s infernal meddling with the economy, and most of the other nations of the world have become People’s States, whose inhabitants are actually grubbing up roots to keep themselves alive. The last sparks of industrial competence are concentrated in the minds of two dozen — at most — American businessmen, who manage to hold the globe aloft in spite of the best efforts of governments everywhere to bring it down. - Donald Malcolm, the New Yorker

> It runs 1,168 pages, and you won’t want to miss one word. [...] You’ll say it can’t happen here — but it’s happening every day and we sit still while watching our rights as humans being whittled away. - Hedda Hopper

Characters
----------

This book is mostly about the characters in it; the world and the plot are incidental in comparison. Here are the main characters in the first half of the book:

1. Dagny Taggart, Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, and a descendant of Nat Taggart. She loves railroads more than anyone, because they act as the arteries and blood cells of the country, and her dream in life is to run Taggart Transcontinental.

2. Francisco d'Anconia, a descendant of Sebastian d'Anconia, who built a copper mining empire centuries ago. Each generation of d'Anconia grew the empire slightly larger than the last, but Francisco d'Anconia was a hard-working genius who managed to grow the business far more quickly than his ancestors. But Francisco's behavior changed about ten years ago:

    > At the age of twenty-three, when he inherited his fortune, Francisco d'Anconia had been famous as the copper king of the world. Now, at thirty-six, he was famous as the richest man and the most spectacularly worthless playboy on earth. He was the last descendant of one of the noblest families of Argentina. He owned cattle ranches, coffee plantations and most of the copper mines of Chile. He owned half of South America and sundry mines scattered through the United States as small change. 

    > "the rebirth of [...] the world — has to start here, in the United States. This country was the only country in history born [...] as a rational product of man's mind." - Francisco d'Anconia

3. Henry "Hank" Rearden is Ayn Rand's new-money hero, who built the most important steel business in the United States on the outskirts of Philadelphia. His company, Rearden Steel, is supplied by Rearden Ore, Rearden Coal, and Rearden Limestone. Rand portrays Rearden as a lone genius (a concept I regard as a [dangerously disheartening myth](https://www.nobelprize.org/martin-chalfie-npii-canada/)) who develops an incredible alternative to steel that contains copper and is "half the weight", "twice as safe", and "will last three times longer than any other [metal]", plus it's good for building anything from chicken wire to railways to microphones to airplanes.

4. James "Jim" Taggart, President of Taggart Transcontinental, is Dagny Taggart's brother. At first, James' primary skills appear to be refusing to make decisions, deflecting, and making illogical statements. We later learn that the board elected him president "in the same manner as they refused to walk under a ladder, to propitiate the same kind of fear. They talked about his gift of 'making railroads popular,' his 'good press,' his 'Washington ability.'". James is a deft influence-peddler, friends with all kinds of Washington elites. James also hates competition almost as much as he seems to hate himself, and is angry that oilman Ellis Wyatt "double-crossed" Taggart Transcontinental (who ran one tank train per week for him on their old track) by doing business with Phoenix-Durango instead (who lets him run two tank trains every day).

Aside from these main characters there are many secondary ones, such as:

- Eddie Willers, who was a child friend with Dagny and Francisco, who used to all hang out together for one month each summer. Eddie is Dagny's competent assistant, basically a more naive and modestly less successful version of Dagny.

- Hank's unemployed family, who lives at his house. There's Hank's mother, who constantly attacks Hank for loving his job and not being a people-pleaser. There's Lillian Rearden, Hank's wife, who at least criticizes Hank more cheerfully than his mother does, and dutifully provides her body for his sexual needs. Finally there's Philip, who has "always placed the public good above any personal consideration" and contributes his time and Hank's money to various organizations including "Friends of Global Progress" (which Lillian also supports) in their crusade for the "Equalization of Opportunity Bill". This bill, to Hank's horror, would forbid any person or corporation to own more than one "business concern", but Hank can't believe such a bill would ever pass (you and me both, Hank!)

- The incompetent and vaguely socialist businessmen. Most notable is Orren Boyle, president of Associated Steel, Rearden's competitor, who is well-connected in Washington. These businessmen wouldn't dream of saying they are in business to make money; in fact, some businessmen in the story repeatedly tout that they have never earned a profit, and fall over each other to show how not-greedy they are. The associated companies tend to have collectivist-sounding names like "Amalgamated Switch and Signal" and "United Locomotive Works".

- The honest, competent and productive businessmen: Ellis Wyatt of Wyatt Oil, Ken Danagger of Danagger Coal, Dwight Sanders of Sanders Aircraft, Andrew Stockton of Stockton Foundry, Dan Conway of Phoenix-Durango, Ted Nielsen of Nielsen Motors, Lawrence Hammond of Hammond Cars, Roger Marsh of Marsh Electric. Most of them are in Colorado, which has the fewest laws, and they begin to vanish, one by one, usually after decisions in Washington cause devastating shocks to their business.

- Wesley Mouch, who by the middle of the book seems to have more power than the president of the United States would have, if the president existed. The book never mentions a president, only a "Head of the State" (a seemingly minor character known only as Mr. Thompson, whose first brief appearance is halfway through the book). Rand explains in Chapter 2 that "nobody ever paid any attention to Wesley Mouch," but then Hank Rearden, who knows nothing about Washington except that all the big businesses have a "Washington man", hired Mouch as a lobbyist. Soon afterward, Mouch is the "Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources". The story of Mouch and his implausible rise to power is finally explained in one paragraph in Part 2 Chapter 6.

- The elite Washington-friendly, anti-profit elites, whom we first encounter when Lillian Rearden invites them to her anniversary party: Bertram Scudder, Dr. Simon Pritchett and Balph Eubank.

- Dr. Robert Stadler and Dr. Floyd Ferris of the State Science Institute. Robert Stadler, the official head of the SSI, was "the greatest physicist of his time" at the age of 30 and once said "Free scientific inquiry? The first adjective is redundant". At age 40 he endorsed the establishment of a State Science Institute, pleading "set science free of the rule of the dollar." Aside from this, Stadler is a figurehead who doesn't care about politics or life outside the realm of science. Meanwhile, Floyd Ferris, "co-coordinator", is a rotten pseudo-intellectual who seems to be the true head of the SSI.

As you can begin to guess, Rand had essentially two kinds of character: those of positive affect, and those of negative affect. Virtually everyone is either a Rational Man of Action Who Seeks A Life of Joy (usually book-smart), or an Irrational Buck-Passer Who Blames Others For Zis Problems While Mumbling About Fairness And Morality (occasionally book-smart). In Part 1 of the book, the good guys rarely speak of morality while the bad guys speak of it frequently. Eventually the good guys develop a moral code based simply on thinking through their own intuitions (which are informed by their experience and their distaste for the bad guys). The evidence vindicating their philosophy is simply the obviousness of how wrong the Buck-Passers are, and the obviousness of how right the Men of Action are.

Note that Lillian, James, Ferris, Stadler and Hank's mother are quite different from each other in terms of their speech and skills, but they are all mostly devoid of likeable qualities. Good characters like Dagny, Rearden, Wyatt and Cherryl Brooks likewise vary, but end up with identical values. Both types are selfish, one openly, one secretly. Both types think of themselves as victims. No characters have any meaningful altruism; those who claim to posess any are just lying to themselves.

On the whole, Rand's "bad" characters are something like Joe McCarthy's [outgroup](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) at the bottom of his [death spiral of hate](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Affective_death_spiral).

No black or asian people are mentioned in Atlas Shrugged, and there are few women of significance aside from Dagny and Lillian. One might hope that Rand or her future world is "color-blind", but I don't think so: at one point Boyle casually uses the word "Spic" when speaking to James.

Review
--------

I have to credit Rand for having _some_ understanding of evil and irrationality. Rand at least understood that every man is the hero of his own story - her villains don't believe they are villains, and would (almost) never stoop so low as to use physical violence to get what they want. This, even though Rand clearly and frequently labeled everything about them as "evil", and every government policy as the use of "force" - if you're familiar with American libertarianism, you can't fail to notice how close Rand's worldview is to theirs. Indeed, the central plot clearly demonstrates, albeit with few details and low plausibility, just how forceful and destructive government policy can hypothetically be.

Rand also wrote skillfully the foolish, exaggerated doubletalk of her villains. I was genuinely impressed, because I have no idea how to speak like the most mentally stunted rabble on YouTube, while Rand seems to have done it effortlessly — though of course it is only the Buck Passers who ever speak so illogically.

However, as I read her book, I felt like one of her heroes, who at first is dimly aware of something wrong in the world, something that makes them uneasy, something that can't possibly be true because it is such an unspeakable evil — but which, in the end, turns out to be completely real and every bit as bad as they could have imagined. In the same way, I became aware of something deeply disturbing in her writing, dimly at first, but something I could only grasp fully around the three-quarter mark.

In the novel, the great evil is a kind of superficial, exaggerated communism (I guess she would call it "collectivism"; at one point she even says "irrationalism") which had, without explanation, conquered all academia, government, the public school system, and the media. But the great evil I saw was something very different, very dangerous, and very... well, very common, ordinary, and banal.

You see, at first I thought that Rand's story was about some kind of conspiracy, a giant power play. I thought that she was hiding some great secret that would be revealed later in the book, some great conspiracy that would make sense in a world that I could imagine.

By the end of Part 2, I recognized the book's great flaw as one big logical fallacy. If I could have described the book in two words, they would have been "false dichotomy" — or perhaps "strawman argument" — because there _really are_ only two kinds of characters, Rand's ideal human, and its opposite. Since no other kind of person exists in her world, there is no Plato for her Aristotle: no one rational enough to argue against her objectivist ideology or poke any holes in her arguments.

TV villains routinely do things that don't make any sense: the villain who repeatedly murders his own lieutenants, for no other reason than to demonstrate evilness; the villain who kills someone for knowing about the existence of incriminating documents, instead of simply burning the incriminating documents.

Rand's villains follow the same pattern, but with senseless goals instead of senseless violence, and so we end up with legal "directives" that would make no sense to most people: they have been chosen for their evilness. And not just any evilness, of course, but specifically those Rand opposes, things like charity, redistribution of wealth, irrationality, red tape/regulations, and fairness. Red tape and regulations are often framed as reduced freedom, so it's notable that Rand never describes them that way (she simply says "red tape" and "regulations"), but I don't know what significance to attach to a _lack_ of framing. And Rand tends to distort "fairness" (and "equality") into something superficial, absolute, uneven, and _unfair_, ensuring that it is unworkable, demotivating, and hurts some people and companies dramatically while benefiting others. The villains can figure out how to scheme, connive and control other people, but their brains fail at any other task.

The directives are also arbitrary, undemocratic, foolish, destructive and unfair, but these are not the kind of adjectives Rand uses explicitly or spends the book ranting about; instead, such negative attributes serve to provide negative affect on the Buck-Passers.

Consider the directives issued at the end of Chapter 10:

> The railroads of the country were ordered to reduce the maximum speed of all trains to sixty miles per hour — to reduce the maximum length of all trains to sixty cars — and to run the same number of trains in every state of a zone composed of five neighboring states, the country being divided into such zones for the purpose. _(red tape, charity, superficial fairness)_

> The steel mills of the country were ordered to limit the maximum production of any metal alloy to an amount equal to the production of other metal alloys by other mills placed in the same classification of plant capacity — and to supply a fair share of any metal alloy to all consumers who might desire to obtain it. _(red tape, charity, superficial fairness)_

> All the manufacturing establishments of the country, of any size and nature, were forbidden to move from their present locations, except when granted a special permission to do so by the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. _(red tape / regulations, irrationality)_

> To compensate the railroads of the country for the extra costs involved and "to cushion the process of readjustment," a moratorium on payments of interest and principal on all railroad bonds — secured and unsecured, convertible and non-convertible — was declared for a period of five years. _(redistribution of wealth)_

> To provide the funds for the personnel to enforce these directives, a special tax was imposed on the state of Colorado, "as the state best able to assist the needier states to bear the brunt of the national emergency, " such tax to consist of five per cent of the gross sales of Colorado's industrial concerns. _(redistribution of wealth)_

When I read this, I thought: give me a break! The U.S. is having economic difficulties, so the solution is to **cut** production? To shift trains from areas of high demand to areas of low demand? To arbitrarily punish railroad bondholders?

It was... just... too... stupid. Could she think that the Buck-Passers really would push through a plan this idiotic, with no concern for the next election? (note: Mouch et al were appointed - but the legislators have no concern about having voted to hand over their own power, and Mouch et al have no concern that legislators would vote to take it back.) The book later indicates that the directives were the result of trading favors and power plays in Washington, but there is no explanation of how _special emergency powers_ would be used only to grant a grab-bag of demands by special interest groups that will obviously make the emergency worse. Does Rand expect her _readers_ to believe something this stupid? (Occasionally she drops hints, never in detail, that there have been centuries of indoctrination in schools and colleges, _literally teaching people not to think_.)

Admittedly there are some politicians today taking positions that I feel are bad and stupid, but most of these crazy positions are completely different from anything Rand's characters come up with; it's as if Rand's army of villains dropped in from another planet.

By the time I reached Part 3 Chapter 4, it finally dawned on me: she was not hiding any great conspiracy, and there would be nothing to finally explain the behavior of her characters sensibly. Consider this snippet from Part 2 Chapter 1:

> Then, Wesley Mouch had issued another directive, which ruled that people could get their bonds "defrozen" upon a plea of "essential need": the government would purchase the bonds, if it found the proof of the need satisfactory. There were three questions that no one answered or asked: "What constituted proof?" "What constituted need?" "Essential— to whom?" 

> One was not supposed to speak about the men who, having been refused, sold their bonds for one-third of the value to other men who possessed needs which, miraculously, made thirty-three frozen cents melt into a whole dollar. [...] Then it became bad manners to discuss why one man received the grant defreezing his money, while another had been refused.

Rand sometimes uses the kind of language you see in partisan editorials. How many editorials have you seen saying "no one is asking" a question that the editorial itself (and many others like it) are asking? "One was not supposed to speak about"? "it became bad manners"? Rand is attacking political correctness 50 years before it became fashionable!

But it's more than that: she uses statements like these _as statements of fact_. She didn't write a smear piece; she never tried to smear socialism or "collectivism" — she won't even use those words. Instead, this is _literally_ the way she viewed the world.

She wrote a book the length of _nine ordinary novels_. Can you imagine? Can you imagine how much of her life she much have sunk into this? To write something so empty, with villains so completely ridiculous, in a world where all the people in power _consistently_ do things don't make any logical sense? To fully invest so completely in the premise that communism is the literal opposite of rationality?

The scary realization I came to, finally, was how vacuous the book really was. Not her heroes, mind you — her heroes embodied the philosophy of her life, a life that she lived earnestly and honestly. But her villains! Holy crap! Eventually, she fleshed out her villains in great detail — not to the same extent as her heroes, but still, the level of detail leads me to believe that she _truly believed_ that people like this are commonplace.

Oh, maybe she understood that in real life there are no _perfectly_ horrible people. But I think she thought that that there is _only one_ perfect good and perfect evil, and that her novel describes them both. She saw human beings, not as the complex nuanced variety that they are, but on a simple continuum from "good to evil", "objectivist to collectivist", "capitalist to communist" and "rational to irrational" respectively. To the extent that she saw a second dimension that could vary independently of the first, it was a sensual dimension, on a scale of "sexually liberated" to "Christian". The only character who was simultaneously good and not sexually liberated was Hank Rearden, but he changed by the book's midpoint. 

Given the extreme value she places on honesty (even the villains are relatively honest), I think she's describing her _actual_ belief about how evil socialists _actually_ are, and I think the world in her book is what she fears would _actually_ happen if they _actually_ controlled academia. Furthermore, given that her future world contains no technological advancements, her premise might be that they were _already_ in control of academia by 1957 (however, the story is incoherent in this regard: five amazing — and probably impossible — new inventions appear over the 12-year course of the story, which I cannot reconcile with the stagnation that came before). Google's first result for "what Rand believed about the real world" backs this up:

> Rand herself stated, "My characters are never symbols, they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight. ... My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings"

Rand's writing is common, ordinary, and banal in the sense that it often sounds like I would expect an anti-communist editoral from the 1950s to sound. What does the book have to say about the teachings corrupting the men of her future world? It's the same pithy phrases those editorials would have used to describe the teachings of communism (and mysticism, if there were editorials against that), things like "individual ability is of no consequence" and "the law of causality [is] a superstition" — that's all, _nothing_ else. It's disturbing on various levels: because she was 100% serious, because she could write like this for 1168 pages, and because a champion of rationality ought to know better.

Blind Spots
-----------

Atlas Shrugged is written as though key elements of human society are invisible to Ayn Rand.

The book is overwhelmingly dominated by individuals - individualists on the one hand (good, thing-oriented), and collectivists on the other (bad, people-oriented). The interesting part is that while she considers _physical_ systems in some detail, _social_ systems and institutions are thoroughly ignored.

Never once is the U.S. President mentioned, nor is the constitution for most of the book. The story seems to be meant as a cautionary tale, so it is strange that the book never more than hints at any altered political structure in the United States, and never has anything to say about what happened to cause the changes. It's all "causeless" (to borrow a word she used 29 times in the book).

She mentions a few times the churn of trade and the economy: how ore is moved by rail to steel mills, how ball bearings are made and shipped to factories that use them, how trains and rails and sidings and signals and platforms help ship goods around the country. Rand seems to understand both the importance of heavy industry and its functional details, and she does a better job than I could of casually explaining them.

Yet political structures seem entirely off her radar: the constitution, the electoral college, first-past the post elections, the court system, the president, the bicameral congress, city councils, the ways candidates can and cannot get campaign funding - such structural elements and institutions of government are never mentioned, as though Rand believes they simply don't matter (there is a "legislature", but its only purpose is to hand over emergency powers to Wesley Mouch and the Head of State, with no explanation of how or why this happens.)

Nongovernmental institutions are largely ignored as well. Not a single news organization has a name; they are simply "the press" and they seem uniformly to speak as one voice with the Men in Washington about "fairness" and "greedy corporations" and "helping the needy". There is a "union" of railroad companies, but their main role in the book is to vote against competition with an "anti-Dog-eat-dog rule" (no motive for passing this rule is given at first, but the book eventually explains that it was a backroom deal among the Buck-Passers). The book's main role for colleges and universities is for them to close as the economy collapses. Banks don't really play a role either. Nonprofits are useless at best. Workers' unions support foolish, but ironically self-interested policies.

Even the ancient institution of the _family_ is ignored. Slowly, virtually every competent leader of every major company "vanishes" (quits and hides) as well as numerous important managers, and later, most industry veterans break the law when they quit and hide. _What about their families?_ Why don't they have families? The story wouldn't work very well if they did.

It is not until Part 2 Chapter 6 that we learn that Rearden Steel actually has a union, and this is mentioned only because the head of the union quits:

> The  first  man  to  quit  at  Rearden  Steel  was  Tom  Colby,  rolling  millforeman, head of the Rearden Steel Workers Union. For ten years, he hadheard  himself  denounced  throughout  the  country,  because  his  was  a “company union” and because he had never engaged in a violent conflict with the management.  This was true: no conflict had ever been necessary; Rearden paid a higher wage scale than any union scale in the country, forwhich he demanded—and got—the best labor force to be found anywhere.

Given the decline of unions in the decades since 1957, it's interesting that Rand takes unions so much for granted that the existence of a union at Rearden's company isn't important enough to mention for several hundred pages. Notice also that Rand's hero pays high wages. No doubt this is not because Rearden is "fair" (one of Rand's four-letter words, alongside "practical") but because he wants to buy "the best" people. Yet wouldn't he be able to pay lower average wages if there wasn't a union, and keep more profit for himself? Rand's character publicly tells everyone that he only cares about making money, and does not shy away from lavish spending on himself and family or friends, but it's clear that Rand's heroes are not as greedy as they proudly claim they are.

Atlas Shrugged has nothing like a telecommunications firm using a monopoly on telephone wires to keep rates high, nothing like an Apple corporation extracting 30% of sales on all apps made by other companies, nothing like a John Deere corporation trying to prevent "unauthorized" parties from repairing tractors, no patent trolls, no old-money people living well off interest from a diversified portfolio without working for a living.

This is not the kind of book that would consider whether it is a grave injustice for the government to use tax money to build paved roads in front of the houses of the taxpayers, allowing any yahoo with a car to freely drive past houses that don't belong to him, or whether the government can ever be justified in putting copper wires or fiber-optic lines or sewers or fresh-water pipes under these roads using (gasp!) funds from income taxes.

Nor does the book consider whether children have a "right" to an education and, if so, whether it's okay for the government to pay for educating the children of the unemployed. Should governments ever help with health care? No one ever gets a serious illness (or mental illness) in the book, let alone someone with a low-paying job, so she can ignore this too.

The pirate Ragnar Danneskjöld, one of Rand's "good" characters, treats income tax as simple theft (the others don't disagree on this point), so he would presumably insist that the water pipes must be built and owned by one person or corporation, to be rented out to those who depend on it at any price the market will bear, and that children should only be educated if the necessary funds are given freely by private citizens, and that the street is a proper home for a schizophrenic who loses a job. But Rand's _actual_ solution to these kinds of questions is to ignore them.

Instead, Rand sticks to the easy question: which is better, a "greedy" unionized steel manufacturer trying to sell the country cheaper, stronger metal than everyone else, or filthy collectivist scumbags making secret backroom deals in an effort to steal from the rich and give to the lazy? Ironically, this decision has exactly the effect she decries in her enemies: it shields her from having to think about any hard questions whatsoever. She describes enemies whose minds are twisted into pretzels by their illogical ideology, but her book's entire world is twisted into a pretzel to fit _her_ ideology.

The story provides glimpses of people who are able and willing to work hard, but end up poor and destitute anyway, but it never asks itself whether Rand's preferred form of government would sometimes produce such outcomes and whether, if so, it would be just. Moreover, the story relies on the secrecy and perfect conviction of the deserters; it never tries to figure out whether her utopic ideas would work in any other context.

I appreciate Ayn Rand's understanding of people who care not about trading favors, about smalltalk and social pleasantries, about beating others down, people whose dream is to do good work, to accomplish great things, and to live happily (people like me).

Yet it strikes me that at least two of the heroes of the story, Francisco d'Aconia and Dagny Taggart, are people who inherited a fortune and a grand opportunity to succeed in life. And we see the same phenomenon in real life, of course, in people like the Koch Brothers or Donald Trump or [these 16 billionaires who inherited their money](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-who-inherited-their-money-2016-1). Could Francisco and Dagny have been as important as they were, had they not been born into a family dynasty? In the world of Atlas Shrugged, I don't think so, but this is a question that Rand's heroes never ask. What about a hypothetical objectivist utopia? At least among those who won an equal amount in the genetic lottery of life, does Rand imagine there could be anything close to equality of opportunity in her ideal world? It's hard to tell.

Probably the hardest question the story asks of its readers is whether adultery can be condoned in a loveless marriage. Rand's answer is a resounding "yes". Rand would probably think it better for the would-be adulterer to inform the other spouse of his intended action in advance, but it's not directly stated. Rearden keeps his affair secret from his wife and everyone else, but he only handles it that way because he originally believes in a 1950s-style moral code that condemns sex and is divorce-averse, viewing marriage vows as a solemn, joyless duty that one cannot be seen breaking. Rearden eventually comes to his senses and realizes that his moral code had been wrong, and that his affair is right and just after all.

Closing remarks
---------------

Eventually I decided that the existence of such a strange book was not surprising after all, nor was its popularity. The world contains many unique and unusual individuals. Ayn Rand was one; I am one. But whether they become famous and succeed depends on whether their message resonates with people, and Rand combined the respectable appearance of a philosopher with a popular polemic style.

> "There is always an easy solution to every human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong." - Misquote of H. L. Mencken

Successful scientists and philosophers have been attracted to finding simple explanations and rules, and there are good reasons for this and good reasons to seek them out. Ayn Rand found an attractively simple philosophy of heroic men versus savagery, and sold 29 million copies of Atlas

which rubbed off onto American libertarianism.

> "My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute." - Appendix to Atlas Shrugged

> "Collectivism is the tribal premise of primordial savages who, unable to conceive of individual rights, believed that the tribe is a supreme, omnipotent ruler, that it owns the lives of its members and may sacrifice them whenever it pleases." - Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal

Scott Alexander taught me another, even simpler philosophy that I think works much better: consequentialism, and its well-known variant, [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). The [FAQ that explains consequentialism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/#moral_issues) was the first piece of Scott's writing that I ever saw; without it, I might not read SSC today.

Like the [Mandlebrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), consequentialism is a simple formula with infinitely intricate, well, consequences. For example, I have learned the value of [deontological ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics) through the lens of utilitarianism, in light of the practical capabilities of human beings and the impracticality of enumerating every possible action and predicting the consequences of each.

But, hell, this is just a book review, so I can't really get into it. I will say, though, that if you're sympathetic to objectivist and libertarian philosophies, you'd better check out consequentialism before you make up your mind. And for those who have _already_ made up their mind, just make sure that this quote does **not** sound like you:

> "I have held the same philosophy I now hold, for as far back as I can remember." - Afterword, Atlas Shrugged

Always having held the same beliefs is deeply suspicious: we are not born with a map of reality in our minds, and once we've developed a map it will still contain errors. If you're still stuck on the first interpretation of morality you ever learned, make sure that you at least know [How To Actually Change Your Mind](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind).

Review, Part II
----------------

So yes, it was surprising that Ayn Rand, who sounds so intelligent, could write a book this bad and be taken seriously by so many people.

But if that's all it was, I should not have been surprised. I already know that the world has highly intelligent, politically partisan people who firmly believe they are rational but have beliefs that are clearly bonkers. I know there are highly intelligent liberals and highly intelligent conservatives who will never agree. You can even figure this out _without knowing which side of a debate is right_: it is enough to observe that both sides of a debate are intelligent, that both think they are rational, but _always_ come to the same contradictory conclusions.

Still, there's something disturbing about seeing it up close and personal, to see all the _work_ that went into it, and above all, to see this come from a _philosopher of rationality_!

I suspect that, like most people who are drawn to rationality, 


I once developed a morbid fascination with the behavior of climate science deniers, and I debated them as a hobby. One of them _sounded_ more intelligent and more scientific than any I had ever seen before. But while I would spend eight to twelve hours researching and reading scientific literature for each of my responses, he would spend _at most_ an hour writing a response of equal length. I knew this because the moment I published my post, his reply would appear no more than one hour later. It was scary to me, because we both sounded equally scientific, we both had links to sources (though his sources were much fewer in number, and were just blogs), and I realized that no one who was "sitting on the fence" and overhearing it would be able to tell the difference between us, unless they were internalizing the mental model of the climate system that I was trying to teach, and/or reading the sources. Later I read Yudkowsky, who gave a name to the trick he used: "writing in the [literary genre of science](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4Bwr6s9dofvqPWakn/science-as-attire)".



Maybe that's how Rand wrote her story, I have no idea. But even if each page took only an hour to write, that's 1168 hours writing an empty tale of "rationality" that neither challenged the convictions she had when she started, nor had the intellectual 


once The most intelligent-sounding denier I ever deba

I never really thought 

. She explores her philosophy in such tremendous depth, and she explores _that which she believes her enemies to be_ in such tremendous depth, _still_ ends up with what I think is a deeply misguided worldview.









Atlas Shrugged raises a lot of questions that it doesn't clearly answer.

Did Rand really think this was the direction the U.S. was headed, and did she really think it was plausible for every other country to become communist? I suppose so: it's hard to believe she wrote a story based on a premise she regarded as impossible, and an impossible fantasy world isn't a great place to teach lessons you want everyone to apply in the real world.

It's pretty clear that socialism doesn't produce a well-functioning society in her story, so how could communism take over the world and then, finally, start infecting the United States too? 

  > A passenger, who was a **professor of economics**, remarked to his companion : “Of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievements of our industrial age?”
  
  > Wesley Mouch came from a family that had [...] a tradition of its own: that of being **college-bred** and, therefore, of despising men who were in business.
  
  > "Save it for Jim Taggart, Doc," said Fred Kinnan. "I know what I'm talking about. That's because I never went to college." 

The book implies that schools and colleges corrupt men's minds (at least the ones in the story do), but it says nothing about how this works and why there wouldn't be any counterbalancing "good" (objectivist) professors.

Perhaps Rand thinks that socialist ideas do kinda-sorta work, _but only if the Men of Action don't quit_, and that the world can become socialist if socialist ideas are taught in school. Society collapses only if, on top of this, the Men of Action quit, so having them all quit becomes her plan.

Why are the characters so simplistically good or bad? Note that Lillian, James, Ferris, Stadler and Hank's mother are quite different from each other in terms of their speech and skills, but they are all mostly devoid of likeable qualities. Does Rand believe real humans are like this? Perhaps she worried that if the characters aren't bad enough, readers won't end up hating them like they are supposed to.

But still, why would many of the "bad" characters talk about fairness and love for their fellow men, but then act as if they don't really love anybody (and hate businesspeople specifically)? It's as if she earnestly believes that the world divides neatly into rational, good, thinking people, and irrational bad people who avoid thinking (both types are selfish, one openly, one secretly).

How does Communism take over the world if it is so obviously immoral, as Rand believes, that anyone will see it is wrong just by using their brain a little? (Part 2 Chapter 10 has a feeble answer to this.) And then, why does she think people in colleges don't use their brains?

I might think Rand regards almost everyone else as stupid, so that it is necessary to teach them what's right way by repeating details of her moral system hundreds of times over thousands of paragraphs. This explanation doesn't work very well, because stupid people don't read 1168-page tomes. Perhaps, instead, her hope was that smart people would read the book, and that it was necessary to repeat the same ideas so many times that they would be imprinted upon other brains thoroughly enough to turn people into carbon copies of Rand, a meta-strategy to spread her ideology far and wide. It's an attractive explanation: if she believes socialist propaganda is highly effective, it's logical for her to fight with propaganda of her own. I don't know, maybe it worked.

But the press are consistently, uniformly opposed to Rearden Metal, so why does the new rail line seem so popular among the commoners? If propaganda works, why did it work so poorly in this case? One hypothesis might involve the fact that the commoners in question live in the least-regulated part of the country.

Why are the press consistently allied with her villains, no matter how bad the economic disaster gets? There is no hint that freedom of the press was canceled; is Rand the sort of person who would believe in a grand mainstream media conspiracy? Or perhaps she thinks good people don't become journalists.

Why does Dr. Stadler believe himself powerless at the SSI?

Did Rand intend her characters or world to be realistic? If so, it's disturbingly naive; if not, it's foolish to try to extrapolate situations, actions, consequences and morality from the book's world to the the real world.


















































Her descriptions of locations and feelings and events are also largely eloquent, often symbolic, and even poetic, but I must admit to not enjoying them; poetry isn't my thing, especially if there's too much of it. I mean, what does a "coil of steam" look like? "angular tiers"? "chips of light"? "air torn to rags"?

> The floors of its hallways were mirrors made of marble. The frosted rectangles of its electric fixtures were chips of solid light.

> The passengers saw distant structures under a faint, reddish glow in the sky; the glow moved in irregular spasms, as if the structures were breathing.

> The window frame trembled with the speed of the motion, the pane hung over empty darkness, and dots of light slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. 

> When the freight train vanished, they saw angular buildings wrapped in coils of steam. The rays of a few strong lights cut straight sheafs through the coils.

> Fountains of sparks shot in beating spasms, as from broken arteries. The air seemed torn to rags, reflecting a raging flame that was not there, red blotches whirling and running through space, as if not to be contained within a man-made structure, as if about to consume the columns, the girders, the bridges of cranes overhead. But the liquid metal had no aspect of violence.

> She noticed the particular quality of Francisco's smile again, one night, when she sat with him and Eddie at a bonfire they had built in the woods. The glow of the fire enclosed them within a fence of broken, moving strips that held pieces of tree trunks, branches and distant stars. 

> She did not turn to the door of her room. He did not move. At the level of their feet, there was nothing but a thin railing and a spread of space. Angular tiers descended below, with shadows repeating the steel tracery of derricks, criss-crossing sharp, black lines on patches of glowing rock. A few lights, white and red, trembled in the clear air, like drops of rain caught on the edges of steel girders.

weird descriptions of everything...
"red rays circling through steam like the long needles ofspotlights"
"Through the swirling coils ofsteam around him"
"A hazy glow, rusted by frost, flashed above the roof of a factory once in a rare while"
"The movement of his arm, as he raised his glass, went from the portrait—to her—to himself—to the buildings of the city beyond the window."
"His head drawn into his shoulders"
"The light trickled down through the branches andshot upward in sudden spurts when it hit a clump of ferns that became afountain of green rays."

Faces are like telegraphs...
She saw him smiling strangely, a smile of sadness, gratitude andlonging.
He looked at her with a smile that had the luminous sincerity of innocenceand pain
Dr. Ferris did not smile as he walked toward Rearden’s desk; he merelywore a look suggesting that Rearden knew full well that he had good reasonto smile and so he would abstain from the obvious.
When he was close enough and she could distinguish his face, she saw thelook of that luminous gaiety which transcends the solemn by proclaiming thegreat innocence of a man who has earned the right to be light-hearted.



A series of policies that simply don't make sense.
- There are national shortages... so we need an emergency measure to limit production?
  - err... "he was now on trial for thegreedy crime of withholding from the public a load of the Metal which it hadbeen his greedy crime to offer in the public market"
to protect thepeople’s security, to achieve full equality and total stability, it is decreed forthe duration of the national emergency that—
- "“Point Four. No new devices, inventions, products, or goods of any naturewhatsoever,  not  now  on  the  market,  shall  be  produced,  invented,manufactured or sold after the date of this directive. The Office of Patentsand Copyrights is hereby suspended ."
- "“Point Five. Every establishment, concern, corporation or person engagedin production of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth produce the sameamount of goods per year as it, they or he produced during the Basic Year, nomore and no less. The year to be known as the Basic or Yardstick Year is tobe the year ending on the date of this directive. Over or under productionshall be fined, such fines to be determined by the Unification Board."
- “Point Six. Every person of any age, sex, class or income, shall henceforthspend the same amount of money on the purchase of goods per year as he orshe  spent  during  the  Basic  Year,  no  more  and  no  less.  Over  or  underpurchasing shall be fined, such fines to be determined by the UnificationBoard."

“It  will  end  wasteful  competition,”  said  James  Taggart.  “We’ll  stopscrambling to beat one another to the untried and the unknown. We won’thave to worry about new inventions upsetting the market. We won’t have topour  money  down  the  drain  in  useless  experiments  just  to  keep  up  with
overambitious competitors.”“Yes,” said Orren Boyle. “Nobody should be allowed to waste money onthe new until everybody has plenty of the old. Close all those damn researchlaboratories—and the sooner, the better.”“Yes,” said Wesley Mouch. “We’ll close them. All of them.”“The State Science Institute, too?” asked Fred Kinnan .“Oh, no!” said Mouch. “That’s different. That’s government. Besides, it’sa non-profit institution. And it will be sufficient to take care of all scientificprogress.”
  "Quite sufficient,” said Dr. Ferris.“And what will become of all the engineers, professors and such, whenyou close all those laboratories?” asked Fred Kinnan. “What are they going todo for a living, with all the other jobs and businesses frozen?”“Oh,”  said  Wesley  Mouch.  He  scratched  his  head.  He  turned  to  Mr.Weatherby. “Do we put them on relief, Clem?”“No,” said Mr. Weatherby. “What for? There’s not enough of them to raisea squawk. Not enough to matter.”“I suppose,” said Mouch, turning to Dr. Ferris, “that you’ll be able toabsorb some of them, Floyd?”“Some,” said Dr. Ferris slowly, as if relishing every syllable of his answer.“Those who prove co-operative.”“What about the rest?” said Fred Kinnan.“They’ll have to wait till the Unification Board finds some use for them,”said Wesley Mouch.“What will they eat while they’re waiting?”Mouch shrugged. “There’s got to be some victims in times of nationalemergency. It can’t be helped.”
  
  

  
As if:
"The judge’s bench had been removed from the old Philadelphia courtroom for this occasion, andreplaced by a table on a wooden platform;  It gave the room an atmospheresuggesting the kind of meeting where a presiding body puts something overon a mentally retarded membership."
Francisco looked at him with a fine smile of amusement, as if saying: No?You didn’t want to talk about yourself? And what is it that you’re confessingbut the desperate loneliness which makes the question of my character moreimportant to you than any other question right now?
She  satgracefully not quite straight, as if she were leaning back...
He saw the look of a peculiar panic growing in her eyes: it was not thelook of understanding, but of a ferocious refusal to understand—as if shewanted to turn the violence of her emotion into a fog screen, as if she hoped,not that it would blind her to reality, but that her blindness would makereality cease to exist.
The jolt felt as if the air within the car smashed them forward while thefloor stopped under their feet.

She doesn't trust academia? Thinks college is somehow opposed to business?
A passenger, who was a professor of economics, remarked to his companion : “Of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievements of our industrial age?”
Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty norwealth  nor  distinction  for  many  generations;  it  had  clung,  however,  to  atradition of its own: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despisingmen who were in business. The family’s diplomas had always hung on thewall in the manner of a reproach to the world, because the diplomas had notautomatically  produced  the  material  equivalents  of  their  attested  spiritualvalue.
Wesley  Mouch  had  been  one  of  the  worst  students  and  hadpassionately envied those who were the best. College taught him that he didnot have to envy them at all.

 “Still,I’m worried. The intellectuals are our friends. We don’t want to lose them.They can make an awful lot of trouble.”“They won’t,” said Fred Kinnan. “Your kind of intellectuals are the first toscream when it’s safe—and the first to shut their traps at the first sign ofdanger. They spend years spitting at the man who feeds them—and they lickthe hand of the man who slaps their drooling faces. Didn’t they deliver everycountry of Europe, one after another, to committees of goons, just like thisone here? Didn’t they scream their heads off to shut out every burglar alarmand to break every padlock open for the goons? Have you heard a peep out ofthem since? Didn’t they scream that they were the friends of labor? Do youhear them raising their voices about the chain gangs, the slave camps, thefourteen-hour workday and the mortality from scurvy in the People’s Statesof Europe? No, but you do hear them telling the whip-beaten wretches thatstarvation is prosperity, that slavery is freedom, that torture chambers arebrother-love and that if the wretches don’t understand it, then it’s their ownfault that they suffer, and it’s the mangled corpses in the jail cellars who’re toblame for all their troubles, not the benevolent leaders! Intellectuals? Youmight have to worry about any other breed of men, but not about the modernintellectuals: they’ll swallow anything. I don’t feel so safe about the lousiestwharf rat in the longshoremen’s union: he’s liable to remember suddenly thathe  is  a  man—and  then  I  won’t  be  able  to  keep  him  in  line.  But  theintellectuals? That’s the one thing they’ve forgotten long ago. I guess it’s theone  thing  that  all  their  education  was  aimed  to  make  them  forget.  Doanything you please to the intellectuals. They’ll take it.”“For once,” said Dr. Ferris, “I agree with Mr. Kinnan. I agree with hisfacts, if not with his feelings. You don’t have to worry about the intellectuals,Wesley. Just put a few of them on the government payroll and send them outto preach precisely the sort of thing Mr. Kinnan mentioned: that the blamerests  on  the  victims.  Give  them  moderately  comfortable  salaries  andextremely loud titles—and they’ll forget their copyrights and do a better job
for you than whole squads of enforcement officers.”
  “Yes,” said Mouch. “I know.”




Oddly the formula for Rearden Metal is described as secret rather than patented. This seems odd to me, that Rearden would risk the secret formula getting to other companies, but perhaps forging it requires some unstated special equipment or procedure that no other company could easily replicate. It is also odd because there is a public controversy about the safety of Rearden metal, and in my mental model of the world, having a patented rather than secret formula could be a step toward assuaging such fears.

Dagny: "I can’t understand theirgame, but this much is right: We must not see the world as they want us tosee it. It’s some sort of fraud, very ancient and very vast—and the key tobreak it is: to check every premise they teach us, to question every precept, to—”

“Haven’t you any desire to be of service to humanity?”“I don’t talk that kind of language, Miss Taggart. I don’t think you do,either.”She laughed. “I think we’ll get along together, you and I.”
There is no room in the book for one who is both competent and actually wants to serve humanity.

He lost, for that moment, all the days and dogmas of his past; hisconcepts, his problems, his pain were wiped out; he knew only—as from agreat, clear distance—that man exists for the achievement of his desires, andhe wondered why he stood here, he wondered who had the right to demandthat he waste a single irreplaceable hour of his life, when his only desire wasto seize the slender figure in gray and hold her through the length of whatevertime there was left for him to exist.

"Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money,for money is men’s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyersseize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills allobjective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrarysetter  of  values.  Gold  was  an  objective  value,  an  equivalent  of  wealthproduced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gunaimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn bylegal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of thevictims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: ‘Account overdrawn."

Seems to understand "positive sum":
If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose—because it contains all the others—the fact that they were the people who created the phrase ‘to makemoney.’ No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity—to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as afavor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created.The words ‘to make money’ hold the essence of human morality.

P2 Ch.2:
Stupid plot: “Is . . . is there something wrong, Señor d’Anconia? I mean, on . . . on theStock Exchange?”Francisco jerked his finger to his lips, with a frightened glance. “Keepquiet,” he whispered. “For God’s sake, keep quiet!”The man was shaking. “Something’s . . . wrong?”“You don’t happen to own any d’Anconia Copper stock, do you?” Theman nodded, unable to speak. “Oh my, that’s too bad! Well listen, I’ll tellyou, if you give me your word of honor that you won’t repeat it to anyone.You don’t want to start a panic.”“Word of honor . . .” gasped the man.“What you’d better do is run to your stockbroker and sell as fast as you can—because things haven’t been going too well for d’Anconia Copper, I’mtrying to raise some money, but if I don’t succeed, you’ll be lucky if you’llhave ten cents on your dollar tomorrow morning—oh my! I forgot that youcan’t reach your stockbroker before tomorrow morning—well, it’s too bad,but—”

Francisco d'Aconia goes to a room full of people he hates and that's where he delivers the "secret" that his stock is about to crash - giving the people he hates an early opportunity to sell stock before it drops? The idea that they can't sell before tomorrow morning, but (1) isn't after-hours trading a thing? and (2) the stock price won't open at the bottom; some buyers in the morning will presumably lose their shirt, and (3) wouldn't it make more sense if d'Aconia caused a panic in an attempt to profit himself, by only creating an _illusion_ that the company lost value? (that itself may be illegal, though.)

A bit odd to throw his stock right after making a three-page speech about the wonders of money, too. Perhaps most odd of all that he takes the risk of explaining his whole plan to Hank Rearden.

Rearden: “I don’t know why,” he said. “But I look at people and they seem to be made of nothing but pain. He’s not. You’re not. That terrible hopelessnessthat’s all around us, I lose it only in his presence. And here. Nowhere else.”

Letting the _whole_ world go to hell is the _right_ thing to do?

He  did  not  rise  when  she  entered—he  looked  as  if  he  had  not  quitereturned to the reality of the moment and had forgotten the proper routine—but he smiled at her with such simple benevolence that she found herselfsmiling in answer. She caught herself thinking that this was the way everyhuman being should greet another—and she lost her anxiety, feeling suddenlycertain that all was well and that nothing to be feared could exist.



“Did  you  want  to  see  it [your railway] used  by  whining  rotters  who  never  rouse themselves to any effort, who do not possess the ability of a filing clerk, but demand the income of a company president, who drift from failure to failure and expect you to pay their bills, who hold their wishing as an equivalent of your work and their need as a higher claim to reward than your effort, who demand that you serve them, who demand that it be the aim of your life to serve  them,  who  demand  that  your  strength  be  the  voiceless,  rightless, unpaid, unrewarded slave of their impotence, who proclaim that you are born to serfdom by reason of your genius, while they are born to rule by the grace of incompetence, that yours is only to give, but theirs only to take, that yours is to produce, but theirs to consume, that you are not to be paid, neither in matter nor in spirit, neither by wealth nor by recognition nor by respect nor by gratitude—so that they would ride on your rail and sneer at you and curse you, since they owe you nothing, not even the effort of taking off their hats which you paid for? Would this be what you wanted? Would you feel proudof it?”
“I’d blast that rail first,” said Rearden, his lips white.

He looked at the people around him. They had cheered him today; they hadcheered him by the side of the track of the John Galt Line.

The newspapers were silent. After the exaggerated attention they had givento the case, they acted as if the trial were not worthy of notice. They printedbrief accounts on unlikely pages, worded in such generalities that no readercould discover any hint of a controversial issue.

Rearden is "sorry" that he will be helping people who are trying to work for the public good or for people who think "no controls" is too few controls.
“I don’t like the things you said at your trial,” said another man. “In myopinion, I don’t agree with you at all. Personally, I’m proud to believe that Iamworking for the public good, not just for my own profit. I like to thinkthat I have some goal higher than just earning my three meals a day and myHammond limousine.”“And  I  don’t  like  that  idea  about  no  directives  and  no  controls,”  saidanother. “I grant you they’re running hog-wild and overdoing it. But—nocontrols at all? I don’t go along with that. I think somecontrols are necessary.The ones which are for the public good.”“I am sorry, gentlemen,” said Rearden, “that I will be obliged to save yourgoddamn necks along with mine.”



From the "well that's not true" department: "The man who despises himself tries  to  gain  self-esteem  from  sexual  adventures—which  can’t  be  done, because sex is not the cause, but an effect and an expression of a man’s sense of his own value.”"
The men who think thatwealth  comes  from  material  resources  and  has  no  intellectual  root  ormeaning, are the men who think—for the same reason—that sex is a physicalcapacity which functions independently of one’s mind, choice or code ofvalues. They think that your body creates a desire and makes a choice for youjust about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into railroad railsof its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason andmocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man’s sexual choice is theresult and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.
Yeah, no.

"sex is themost profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which he cannot perform for anymotive but his own enjoyment—just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity!"
I have thought of sex in precisely this manner for many years. If I was incapable of sexual pleasure but remained physically able, I would have no problem performing a sex act for someone I love or care about (though I would not be willing to do it as often as I would with my pleasure intact).
"—an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exaltation,  only  in  the  confidence  of  being  desired  and  being  worthy  of desire." Another strange claim; many people think masturbation and sex are self-abasement, and many people have sex because they need it or want it, without any concern about whether the other person desires them or whether they are worthy of desire. 

Supervisors are quitting "without reason" in a time of economic depression, when infrastructure is in the process of collapsing? Throughout the story most of the population and the entirety of the press seem unconcerned that infrastructure is breaking down and that various transportation lines are shutting down. 
Danagger’s cousin explainedthat he could not help it; he had had to cut the workday down to six hours, hesaid, in order to raise the morale of the men who did not seem to function asthey had in the days of his cousin Kenneth; the men had become listless andsloppy, he said, because they were exhausted by the harsh discipline of theformer management; he could not help it if some of the superintendents andforemen had quit him without reason, men who had been with the companyfor ten to twenty years
Locey pushed Mitchum intothe first job that came up—superintendent of the Colorado Division—whenthe man holding it quit without notice. The man quit when the extra Dieselengine of Winston Station was given to Chick Morrison’s Special.

"nobody noticed the closing of acommission  house  in  New  York,  of  a  plumbing  company  to  which  thecommission house owed money, of a lead pipe wholesaler who had suppliedthe plumbing company. When people were starving, said the newspapers, one did not have to feel concern over the failures of business enterprises whichwere only private ventures for private profit."
The whole book is like this: the press is always the enemy. Rand's press is never concerned that civilization is crumbling, and Rand never supposes that this "evil" behavior requires a logical explanation. To the contrary, she seems to believe that broad swaths of society including the entire media simply have an "evil" hodgepodge of rotten socialist beliefs that cause them to act with a consistent and inexplicable irrationally.

An optimistic libertarian might suppose that Rand's dystopian world looks nothing like our own world because Atlas Shrugged succeeded in warning society against going down any path that resembles socialism. But it seems clear enough that the societies of Europe and Canada and, for that matter, even the Chinese, have managed to avoid anything resembling Rand's dystopia without ever being fans of Ayn Rand. (And Maccarthyism came first...)

I have to give Rand credit for doing something I could not do: write numerous paragraphs and poetry supporting a position she finds abhorrent. Perhaps she was once on a debate team that was assigned a side and forced to defend an arbitrary position with any possible logic, no matter how illogical or impossible. 


“You must learn to take a philosophical attitude,” said Dr. Simon Pritchettto a young girl student who broke down into sudden, hysterical sobs in themiddle of a lecture. She had just returned from a volunteer relief expeditionto a settlement on Lake Superior; she had seen a mother holding the body of agrown  son  who  had  died  of  hunger.  “There  are  no  absolutes,”  said  Dr.Pritchett. “Reality is only an illusion. How does that woman know that herson is dead? How does she know that he ever existed? ”

So Mr. Mouch controls the press now?
"the demands for the cut in rates were still heard in the press—and Taggarthad known what it meant, if Mr. Mouch still permitted them to be heard; hehad known that the knife was still poised at his throat."




(The closest thing to a POTUS appears first in P2Ch6:)
Mr.  Thompson,  the  Head  of  the  State,  was  a  man  who  possessed  thequality of never being noticed. In any group of three, his person becameindistinguishable, and when seen alone it seemed to evoke a group of its own,
composed of the countless persons he resembled. The country had no clearimage of what he looked like: his photographs had appeared on the covers ofmagazines as frequently as those of his predecessors in office, but peoplecould never be quite certain which photographs were his and which werepictures of “amail clerk” or “awhite-collar worker,” accompanying articlesabout  the  daily  life of  the  undifferentiated

They wished the directive to go into effect. They wished it could be putinto effect without words, so that they would not have to know that what theywere doing was what it was. Nobody had ever announced that Directive No.10-289 was the final goal of his efforts. Yet, for generations past, men hadworked to make it possible, and for months past, every provision of it hadbeen prepared for by countless speeches, articles, sermons, editorials—bypurposeful voices that screamed with anger if anyone named their purpose.

It's as though Rand can see only people and objects, with institutions only rarely, vaguely glimpsed in her peripheral vision. The union of railroad workers, for example, plays no role separate from its president, who is of course one of the many villians of the story, but not an important one, merely one more person making demands of the "greedy corporations" that are almost bankrupt by the time he is mentioned for the first time. There's a "progressive" lobby group called "Friends  of  Global  Progress" that we never learn much about.

Who is Wesley Mouch? He appears early in the story, but at that time seems of little importance.
Backstory appears in P2Ch6:
Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty norwealth  nor  distinction  for  many  generations;  it  had  clung,  however,  to  atradition of its own: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despisingmen who were in business. The family’s diplomas had always hung on thewall in the manner of a reproach to the world, because the diplomas had notautomatically  produced  the  material  equivalents  of  their  attested  spiritualvalue. Among the family’s numerous relatives, there was one rich uncle. Hehad married his money and, in his widowed old age, he had picked Wesley ashis favorite from among his many nephews and nieces, because Wesley wasthe  least  distinguished  of  the  lot  and  therefore,  thought  Uncle  Julius,  thesafest. Uncle Julius did not care for people who were brilliant. He did notcare for the trouble of managing his money, either; so he turned the job overto Wesley. By the time Wesley graduated from college, there was no moneyto  manage.  Uncle  Julius  blamed  it  on  Wesley’s  cunning  and  cried  thatWesley was an unscrupulous schemer. But there had been no scheme aboutit;  Wesley  could  not  have  said  just  where  the  money  had  gone.  In  highschool,  Wesley  Mouch  had  been  one  of  the  worst  students  and  hadpassionately envied those who were the best. College taught him that he didnot have to envy them at all. After graduation, he took a job in the advertisingdepartment of a company that manufactured a bogus corn-cure. The cure soldwell and he rose to be the head of his department. He left it to take charge ofthe advertising of a hair-restorer, then of a patented brassière, then of a newsoap, then of a soft drink—and then he became advertising vice-president ofan automobile concern. He tried to sell automobiles as if they were a boguscorn-cure.  They  did  not  sell.  He  blamed  it  on  the  insufficiency  of  hisadvertising  budget.  It  was  the  president  of  the  automobile  concern  whorecommended  him  to  Rearden.  It  was  Rearden  who  introduced  him  toWashington—Rearden,  who  knew  no  standard  by  which  to  judge  theactivities of his Washington man. It was James Taggart who gave him a startin the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources—in exchangefor double-crossing Rearden in order to help Orren Boyle in exchange fordestroying Dan Conway. From then on, people helped Wesley Mouch toadvance, for the same reason as that which had prompted Uncle Julius: theywere people who believed that mediocrity was safe. The men who now sat in
front of his desk had been taught that the law of causality was a superstitionand that one had to deal with the situation of the moment without consideringits cause. By the situation of the moment, they had concluded that WesleyMouch was a man of superlative skill and cunning, since millions aspired topower,  but  he  was the  one  who  had  achieved  it.  It  was  not  within  theirmethod of thinking to know that Wesley Mouch was the zero at the meetingpoint of forces unleashed in destruction against one another.


Some of the most cogent Villian language in the book (P2Ch6):

“Fact is,” said Mr. Weatherby primly, in a statistical tone of voice, “that inthe twelve-month period ending on the first of this year, the rate of businessfailures has doubled, as compared with the preceding twelve-month period.Since the first of this year, it has trebled.”“Be sure they think it’s their own fault,” said Dr. Ferris casually.“Huh?” said Wesley Mouch, his eyes darting to Ferris.“Whatever  you  do,  don’t  apologize,”  said  Dr.  Ferris.  “Make  them  feelguilty.”“I’m not apologizing!” snapped Mouch. “I’m not to blame. I need wider
powers.”“But it istheir own fault,” said Eugene Lawson, turning aggressively to Dr.Ferris.  “It’s  their  lack  of  social  spirit.  They  refuse  to  recognize  thatproduction is not a private choice, but a public duty. They have no right tofail, no matter what conditions happen to come up. They’ve gotto go onproducing. It’s a social imperative. A man’s work is not a personal matter,it’s a social matter. There’s no such thing as a personal matter—or a personallife. That’swhat we’ve got to force them to learn.”


P2Ch6:
Lawson looked away. “To hell with them! Why should we worry aboutthem ? We’ve got to run the world for the sake of the little people. It’sintelligence that’s caused all the troubles of humanity. Man’s mind is the rootof all evil. This is the day of the heart. It’s the weak, the meek, the sick andthe humble that must be the only objects of our concern.” His lower lip wastwisting in soft, lecherous motions. “Those who’re big are here to serve thosewho aren’t. If they refuse to do their moral duty, we’ve got to force them.There once was an Age of Reason, but we’ve progressed beyond it. This isthe Age of Love.”
Shut up!” screamed James Taggart.They all stared at him. “For Christ’s sake, Jim, what’s the matter?” saidOrren Boyle, shaking.“Nothing,” said Taggart, “nothing . . . Wesley, keep him still, will you?”Mouch said uncomfortably, “But I fail to see—”“Just keep him still. We don’t have to listen to him, do we?”“Why, no, but—”“Then let’s go on.”“What is this?” demanded Lawson. “I resent it. I most emphatically—” Buthe saw no support in the faces around him and stopped, his mouth sagginginto an expression of pouting hatred.
“Let’s go on,” said Taggart feverishly.“What’s the matter with you?” asked Orren Boyle, trying not to know whatwas the matter with himself and why he felt frightened.“Genius is a superstition, Jim,” said Dr. Ferris slowly, with an odd kind ofemphasis, as if knowing that he was naming the unnamed in all their minds.“There’s no such thing as the intellect. A man’s brain is a social product. Asum of influences that he’s picked up from those around him. Nobody inventsanything,  he  merely  reflects  what’s  floating  in  the  social  atmosphere.  Agenius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas whichrightfully belong to society, from which he stole them. All thought is theft. Ifwe do away with private fortunes, we’ll have a fairer distribution of wealth. Ifwe do away with genius, we’ll have a fairer distribution of ideas.”



The closest it comes to mentioning communism (P2Ch6):
“It’s  a  total  fallacy,”  said  Dr.  Ferris.  “It’s  a  statement  prompted  byignorance.  Every  expert  has  conceded  long  ago  that  a  planned  economyachieves the maximum of productive efficiency and that centralization leadsto super-industrialization.”
  “Centralization destroys the blight of monopoly,” said Boyle.
  “How’s that again?” drawled Kinnan.
  Boyle  did  not  catch  the  tone  of  mockery,  and  answered  earnestly,  “Itdestroys the blight of monopoly. It leads to the democratization of industry. Itmakes everything available to everybody.[...]"

Introduction of famous pirate Ragnar Danneskjöld who introduces himself to Rearden and gives him a solid bar of gold (he explains that he stole it back from those who stole from Rearden):
“You chose to live by means of force, like the rest of them.”
“Yes—openly. Honestly, if you will. I do not rob men who are tied andgagged, I do not demand that my victims help me, I do not tell them that I amacting for their own good. I stake my life in every encounter with men, andthey have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fairbattle. Fair? It’s I against the organized strength, the guns, the planes, thebattleships  of  five  continents.  If  it’s  a  moral  judgment  that  you  wish  topronounce, Mr. Rearden, then who is the man of higher morality: I or WesleyMouch?”“I have no answer to give you,” said Rearden, his voice low.“Why should you be shocked, Mr. Rearden? I am merely complying withthe system which my fellow men have established. If they believe that forceis the proper means to deal with one another, I am giving them what they askfor. If they believe that the purpose of my life is to serve them, let them try toenforce their creed. If they believe that my mind is their property—let themcome and get it.”

“I do approve of it, Mr. Rearden. But I’ve chosen a special mission of myown. I’m after a man whom I want to destroy. He died many centuries ago,but until the last trace of him is wiped out of men’s minds, we will not have adecent world to live in.”“What man?”“Robin Hood. [...] He was the man who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Well, I’m theman who robs the poor and gives to the rich—or, to be exact, the man whorobs the thieving poor and gives back to the productive rich.”
"I have never robbed aprivate ship and never taken any private property. Nor have I ever robbed amilitary vessel—because the purpose of a military fleet is to protect fromviolence  the  citizens  who  paid  for  it,  which  is the  proper  function  of  agovernment. But I have seized every loot-carrier that came within range ofmy guns, every government relief ship, subsidy ship, loan ship, gift ship,every vessel with a cargo of goods taken by force from some men for theunpaid, unearned benefit of others. I seized the boats that sailed under theflag of the idea which I am fighting: the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrifices—that the need of some men is the knife of aguillotine hanging over others [....]
“What I actually am, Mr. Rearden, is a policeman. It is a policeman’s duty to protect men from criminals—criminals being those who seize wealth byforce. It is a policeman’s duty to retrieve stolen property and return it to itsowners.  But  when  robbery  becomes  the  purpose  of  the  law,  and  thepoliceman’s duty becomes, not the protection, but the plunder of property—then it is an outlaw who has to become a policeman. I have been selling thecargoes I retrieved to some special customers of mine in this country, whopay me in gold."
"I cannot compute all the money that has been extorted from you—in hidden taxes, in regulations, in wasted time, in  lost  effort,  in  energy  spent  to  overcome  artificial  obstacles.  I  cannotcompute the sum, but if you wish to see its magnitude—look around you. Theextent of the misery now spreading through this once prosperous country isthe extent of the injustice which you have suffered. If men refuse to pay thedebt they owe you, this is the manner in which they will pay for it. But thereis one part of the debt which is computed and on record. That is the partwhich I have made it my purpose to collect and return to you.”
“What is that?”
“Your income tax, Mr. Rearden.”
“What? ”
“Your income tax for the last twelve years.”
“You intend to refund that ?”
“In full and in gold, Mr. Rearden.”
[...]
“But—”
“Are  you  thinking  that  death  and  taxes  are  our  only  certainty,  Mr.Rearden? Well, there’s nothing I can do about the first, but if I lift the burdenof the second, men might learn to see the connection between the two andwhat a longer, happier life they have the power to achieve. They might learnto hold, not death and taxes, but life and production as their two absolutesand as the base of their moral code.”
[...]
“Why?” whispered Rearden.“Because my only love, the only value I care to live for, is that which hasnever  been  loved  by  the  world,  has  never  won  recognition  or  friends  ordefenders: human ability. That is the love I am serving—and if I should losemy life, to what better purpose could I give it?”

Overall, Rearden is not pleased:
When the moment was over, he said quietly, his voice firm and dead, “Take that gold ofyours and get away from here. I won’t accept the help of a criminal.”



P2Ch7 Gilbert Keith-Worthing:
“Your country is so incredibly naïve. It’s such an anachronism. All thattalk about liberty and human rights—I haven’t heard it since the days of my great-grandfather. It’s nothing but a verbal luxury of the rich. After all, itdoesn’t make any difference to the poor whether their livelihood is at themercy of an industrialist or a bureaucrat. ”

P2Ch7:
But years ago, in grammar school, in highschool, in college, Kip Chalmers had been taught that man does not and neednot live by reason.

The book has numerous conversations that sound something like this this one started by a politician in Part 2 Chapter 7:

"Tell your engineer that I must be in San Francisco by evening and that he’s got to get me there!”
“How?”
“That’s your job, not mine!”
“There is no way to do it.”
“Then find a way, God damn you!”
The conductor did not answer.
“Do you think I’ll let your miserable technological problems interfere with crucial social issues? Do you know who I am? Tell that engineer to startmoving, if he values his job!”
“The engineer has his orders.”
“Orders be damned! Igive the orders these days! Tell him to start at once!"

In this case it's impossible to reach San Francisco by evening because only coal-powered engines are available, and they need to travel on an upward grade through an 8-mile-long tunnel with inadequate ventilation. Most of the employees in the train and at the station are aware it would be deadly for this passenger train to go through that tunnel, but the chapter explains, in detail, how an incompetent chain of management combined with the fear induced in employees by Emergency Directive No. 10-289, conspire to send the train through the tunnel anyway and kill everyone aboard.

But somehow Rand can't send them to their deaths without explaining first, in some detail, that every single person on the train (aside from the children) had a belief or an occupation that I suppose Rand would not approve of.

  consumer, she had "a right" to transportation, whether the railroad people 
  wished to provide it or not. 

> The man in Roomette 2, Car No. 9, was a professor of economics who 
  advocated the abolition of private property, explaining that intelligence 
  plays no part in industrial production, that man's mind is conditioned by 
  material tools, that anybody can run a factory or a railroad and it's only a 
  matter of seizing the machinery. 

 > The woman in Roomette 9, Car No. 12, was a housewife who believed that she had the right to elect politicians, of whom she knew nothing, to control giant industries, of which she had no knowledge.

What's up with that?




How long is the alternate timeline? P2Ch7
" He did not know that his vision ofa railroad and its executives was that of a century ago."
The error was made centuries ago, itwas made by Sebastián d’Anconia, by Nat Taggart, by every man who fedthe world and received no thanks in return

The book talks about "evil" until you're either sick of hearing it or an enlightened libertarian or anti-socialist.

Contradiction?: P2Ch10: "t was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own needor ability. We votedon it. [...] in a public meetingtwice a year." 
"In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used tochip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born we didn’t speak to theparents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers"
he had pale eyesthat looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, youshould have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some manwho’d talked back to her once and who’d just heard his name on the list ofthose getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw thereal  motive  of  any  person  who’s  ever  preached  the  slogan:  ‘From  eachaccording to his ability, to each according to his need.’
“This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could bepossible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world couldmake  a  mistake  of  this  size  and  preach,  as  righteousness,  this  sort  ofabomination—when  five  minutes  of  thought  should  have  told  them  whatwould happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I knowthat they didn’t do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are nevermade innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when theyhave no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice—it’s because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren’tso innocent either, when we voted for the plan at the first meeting. We didn’tdo it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good.We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighborsand from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue somethingthat we’d be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn’t a man voting for itwho didn’t think that under a setup of this kind he’d muscle in on the profitsof the men abler than himself. There wasn’t a man rich and smart enough butthat he didn’t think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this planwould give him a share of his better’s wealth and brain. But while he wasthinking that he’d get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot aboutthe men below who’d get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all hisinferiors who’d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. Theworker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like hisboss’s, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling thattheirneed entitled them to an icebox like his own. Thatwas our real motivewhen we voted—that was the truth of it—but we didn’t like to think it, so theless we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good.

It was the best-cooked food she had ever tasted, the product of simple ingredients and of an unusual skill.




Rand likes to use a peculiar word: causeless.

> the eyes looked straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still—as if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.<br/>
> Dagny., feeling a causeless jolt of dread at the words, out of all proportion to their meaning. 

Does Rand think that the ideas she opposes, and seems to understand only superficially, take hold _causelessly_? That would explain why she's so afraid of them.

No: she thinks selfishness is the cause
